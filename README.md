# trump-chatbot

This is a final project for the Python class offered by Codecademy.
In this project, I created a chatbot using the Markov Chain Macro that Codecademy provided.
I wanted to create a Trump chatbot that users can talk to whenever they wish.

Below are what I did:
1. I scraped 600 most recent tweets, as of Aug 15, 2017, from @realdonaldtrump, and fed those tweets to Markov Chian macro.
2. I created a chatroom in which an user could talk to the chatbot umlimitedly until they entered 'Bye'.
