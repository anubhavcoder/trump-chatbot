# Trump-chatbot

This is a final project for the Python class that I took on Codecademy. In this project, I created a chatbot using the Markov Chain Macro that Codecademy provided (link: XXX). I tried to create a chatbot that any user could talk to whenever they wish. The most interesting part of this project was that I fed all of Trump's tweets to the Markov Chian, which then generated the sentences randomly for the chatbot. That being said, as an user, you would talk to a chatbot that ideally would talk like Trump (or at least talk like how he tweets).

Below are what I did:
1. I scraped 600 most recent tweets, as of Aug 15, 2017, from @realdonaldtrump, and fed those tweets to Markov Chian macro.
2. I created a chatroom in which an user could talk to the chatbot umlimitedly until they entered 'Bye'.
